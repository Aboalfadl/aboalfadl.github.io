# Quick Introduction:

It’s me, Ahmed Aboalfadl, A Cyber security engineer & A Purple teamer with experience +7 years in cyber security. I am interested in doing incident response & digital forensics. I worked before for Trend Micro as an incident response engineer and DFIR Engineer in a local company. 

Recently I’ve been working in a security operation center as SOC Layer 2, I will be sharing some topics,  real and interesting incidents, and other valuable tools that I have developed to help the cyber security community.
I’m very open to discussions and comments.
